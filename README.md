==============

Research and development of a series of sketches and libraries,
conceived in order to experiment with motion control, photography and videomaking. 


Introduction
------------
This will definitely be a W.I.P. for quite some time, before it will actually be usable as a tool;
nonetheless, if you're interested in motion controlling your camera,
you might want to play with the sketches I'll be uploading in the next future.


Documentation
--------------
Currently, the project is presented and discussed only in Italian, on [massMakers](http://massmakers.org).
No real documentation stil exists; if interested, please let me know (twitter @mapofemergence).

#### Discussion
The project will be discussed, while in development, with the [tag _openDolly_ on massMakers](http://massmakers.org/tag/opendolly).
Again, by now the posts are in Italian only; but if interest grows,
the discussion will be translated and switched to English.
